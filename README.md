# arduino_minigame_falling_dots

This project is an Arduino-based mini-game where players control a character to dodge falling dots. 
The game utilizes an OLED screen for display and a video game controller for movement. 

Note: The characters I used aren't my own but I included them because I did the pixel art myself
